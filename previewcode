###1-  Python Print Function
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

### 2 - string manipulation

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

#settings --> code intelligence to see where the error is
# debug comes from mug stuck in the computer made the code bug

### 3 - input function 
 
print(len(("What is your name? ")))

#input --> does not stop like print
#what if we want to enter some data, instead of printing it --> input function 
input("A prompt for the use") 
#now you can actually give data, then the code gives it
input("What is your name?")
#in print the prompt
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
#input is nested inside the print code

# 3.2 input function exercise
#program to print the number of character in the name of someone
input("What is your name? ")
# search for answers on stack overflow
#len("") print the number, length print(len("Angela"))
print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# 4 variables
input("What is your name? ")
#if we give a name to this function, we can refer to it later
name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)
# now we can get back to this, refer to this information
name = "Jack"
print(name)
name = "Angela"
#but if we want to change that data later on
#now it is holding on to the value of Angela
#can now put name 
name = input("What is your name?")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# exercise --> Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

c = a
a = b
b = c

print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

#5 naming variable
#can call whatever as long as consistent 
#can't have a space in between 
user_name = input("What is your name")
#if wanna use number
length2 = len(n)
#can't be at the begining
#don't use other functions as names 

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("WELCOME TO DMB")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.

#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
