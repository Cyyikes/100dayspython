###1-  Python Print Function
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

### 2 - string manipulation

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

#settings --> code intelligence to see where the error is
# debug comes from mug stuck in the computer made the code bug

### 3 - input function 
 
print(len(("What is your name? ")))

#input --> does not stop like print
#what if we want to enter some data, instead of printing it --> input function 
input("A prompt for the use") 
#now you can actually give data, then the code gives it
input("What is your name?")
#in print the prompt
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
#input is nested inside the print code

# 3.2 input function exercise
#program to print the number of character in the name of someone
input("What is your name? ")
# search for answers on stack overflow
#len("") print the number, length print(len("Angela"))
print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# 4 variables
input("What is your name? ")
#if we give a name to this function, we can refer to it later
name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)
# now we can get back to this, refer to this information
name = "Jack"
print(name)
name = "Angela"
#but if we want to change that data later on
#now it is holding on to the value of Angela
#can now put name 
name = input("What is your name?")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# exercise --> Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

c = a
a = b
b = c

print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

#5 naming variable
#can call whatever as long as consistent 
#can't have a space in between 
user_name = input("What is your name")
#if wanna use number
length2 = len(n)
#can't be at the begining
#don't use other functions as names 

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("WELCOME TO DMB")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("which city did you grow up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your dancer name could be " + city + " " + pet)
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
#   https://replit.com/@appbrewery/band-name-generator-end

# 2.1 Python Primitive Data Types
# String --> get the first character
print("Hello"[0])
#Taking element from a string is called subscripting
#Integer --> without decimal
print(123 + 345)
#can also do 123_0 for 1230
#Flot
3.14159
#Boolean --> use  alot to test if something is true or false and test your program accordingly
True 
False 

# 2.2 Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion
# len function doesn't work with integers
# remember
num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
print("Your name has" + num_char + "characters.")
# GET AN ERROR --> can only put string not integrer between the + .. +
# How to prevent? use function type, gives the type of data
type(num_char)
#integer --> so can't do it
# convert into 
new_num_char = str(num_char)
#now it works

# other example
a = 123
print(type(a))
# could do
a = str(123)
# or
a = float(123)
#what happens?
print(70 + float("100.5"))
#170.5 
#now?
print(str(70) + str(100))
# 70100

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Round the result to 2 decimal places.
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)


# FAQ: How to round to 2 decimal places?

# Find the answer in the Q&A here: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/17965132#questions/13315048


print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
